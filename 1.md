after a cursory examination of [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics with Cats](https://p51lee.github.io/quantum-computing/intro/), it's like doing linear algebra but with objects of theoretically infinite dimension?

in ring notation we may have $a \in R^{m}$ where $R$ is a ring and $m$ is a positive integer, so $R^{m}$ is a vector space in the ring with cardinality $m$. This space contains all matrices/hypercubes with cardinality $m$ (product of cardinality of each dimension) e.g. a $3x3$ matrix can be considered a $9$ element vector

if we wrote $a \in R^{\infty}$ this may be an abuse of notation expression of a quantum variable (element of a hilbert space)? Specifically a vector in a quantum space? Infinity is conceptually not a finite value, it's $(x \in \mathbb{Z^{+}}) + 1$, which implies that infinity is a generalization of the concept of dimension to all possible values (e.g. not just the maximum value or a single chosen value)? Thus a quantum space contains all rings of all shapes and cardinality.

Notably there are two conceptual infinities, the cardinality of each dimension, and the number of dimensions of the structure:
- $R^{\infty}$: quantum vector
- $R^{\infty \times \infty}$: quantum matrix
- An object with $x \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ infinite dimensions would be a quantum hypercube?

this expression is somewhat nonsensical because a vector of infinite cardinality contains all matrices and hypercubes, however it may be good for designing algorithms

can we express structures in the quantum space using ring notation like above? We need addition and multiplication in a ring, if the elements of the structure are in a finite field (strict instance of ring) the shape (cardinality of dimension and number of dimensions) of the structure shouldn't matter, right?
